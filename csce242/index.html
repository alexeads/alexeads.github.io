            <p>This is my website for the Web Applications course in Summer 2025. I have never taken this class before and so far it is interesting but a bit difficult. Everything has to be so perfect and in exactly the right place. I am excited to hopefully complete the course with an A.</p>
            <p>Something that I am very interested in is sports, specifically football and basketball. I am from Philadelphia, therefore I am a huge Eagles and Sixers fan. My two favorite athletes are Jalen Hurts and Joel Embiid. Therefore want my site to have some information and stuff relating to those two teams and athletes. </p>

                    <p>For Assignment 01 I made a basic website on a topic of my choosing. I chose to base it around the Sixers and Eagles because they are my favorite teams. The website had to follow a set of guidelines and contain specific elements.</p>

                    <p>In this assignment I created another basic web page, with similar guidelines and must-haves. Instead, this time there was much more emphasis on styling and presentation. I picked a prettier font, went for pleasing color combinations, and formatted the page to look more presentable. </p>

                    <p>For this assignment I vastly improved how my main website looks. I adapted it mobile and utlized the different techniques we learned in class to improve overall look and presenatation. </p>
