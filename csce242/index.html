        <h2>Web Applications</h2>
        <p>By: Alex Eads</p>
        <p>This is my website for the Web Applications course in Summer 2025. I have never taken this class before and so far it is interesting but a bit difficult. Everything has to be so perfect and in exactly the right place. I am excited to hopefully complete the course with an A.</p>
        <p>Something that I am very interested in is sports, specifically football and basketball. I am from Philadelphia, therefore I am a huge Eagles and Sixers fan. My two favorite athletes are Jalen Hurts and Joel Embiid. Therefore want my site to have some information and stuff relating to those two teams and athletes. </p>
