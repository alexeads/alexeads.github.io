                    My name is Alex Eads and I am a rising senior at the University 
                    of South Carolina. I am from Philadelphia and have always been interested 
                    in starting a restaurant. I have loved pizza since before I could talk 
                    and walk. That is why I have decided to open and start my 
                    own pizza franchise. Together, Robert and I have been building 
                    the franchise, trying to spread the love of pizza to all.

                    My name is Robert Smith and I am a rising senior at the University of
                    South Carolina. I am from Charlotte, North Carolina and I
                    do not have as big of a passion for pizza or restaraunts as 
                    Alex does, but I handle the business end of things. We hope
                    to one day become one of the biggest pizza franchises in the world.
